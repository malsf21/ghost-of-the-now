# ghost-of-the-now

Ghost of the Now is a theme for [Ghost](https://ghost.org) built on the [Now UI Kit](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/now-ui-kit) by Creative-Tim and Invision, which is a Bootstrap 4 theme.

This is a super simple theme that emulates what [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) does, but with a different look and feel. I didn't make this with any website in mind, but to just learn how to make a Ghost theme.
